			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>Calling this webpage <italic>Magicians of Moz</italic> is a bold move. I adore puns. I always name my <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figChristianFrissonPortfolio">projects</xref> with 1-to-3-word aliases to make them easier to remember and talk about, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibChristianFrissonPortfolioprojects">bookmarks</xref>. There are several main ideas contained in <italic>Magicians of Moz</italic>:</p>
			<p>1) Arthur Clarke's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibClarkeThreeLaws">third law</xref> (spotted through a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibTEI2014SDC">recent reminder</xref>) says: <italic>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</italic> This directly applies to the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). This can be applied to other fields from art, science and technology. For instance, sound design in a movie becomes great once it is not noticeable anymore. Technology should serve users and achieve it through the best transparency.</p>
			<p>2) A traditional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibWizardOzUX">usability engineering technique</xref> has been named after the famous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibWizardOzDisambiguation">novel and movie</xref> <italic>The Wizard of Oz</italic>. It allows to evaluate systems with users even when these systems are not yet functional. Human evaluators replicate the desired functionalities. A similar train of thoughts may lead us to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMechanicalTurk">Mechanical Turk</xref>. Amazon's version may be employed for remote user testing, but does raise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibAmazonMechanicalTurkLaborIssues">societal issues</xref>. The term <italic>Magician</italic> is also gender-neutral (as opposed to for instance <italic>Wizard</italic>). Systems and tools should be designed for users and the user-centered design process should be respectful of the people involved.</p>
			<p>3) This is an open cover letter for applying as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozCareerUXR">User Experience Researcher</xref> at Mozilla. There are already lots of magicians at Mozilla, I could discuss with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibKyleMachulis">some</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibPhilippSackl">them</xref>. My passion gets attracted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozUX">Mozilla UX</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozVR">MozVR</xref> teams who prototype and evaluate with users novel ways of browsing the Internet. The plural in <italic>Magicians</italic> means that I want to be part of them. This cover letter, online and open, follows up the new tradition established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibReadyForMozilla">one</xref> of the Mozillians.</p>
			<p>Usually a cover letter may address three main parts: 1) what is being sent and why, 2) who the sender is, and 3) what the sender can make together with the recipient organization. Consider the first part done. I will slightly adapt the two remaining sections. First, I will explain my motivations on how I feel that Mozilla will fullfil my career. Second, I will describe how my values can serve Mozilla. Third, I will sketch some ideas for future work that we can make together.</p>

				<title>Why Mozilla? A user's standpoint.</title>
				<p>I use Mozilla products. Really. I have been relying on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozFirefox">Firefox</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozThunderbird">Thunderbird</xref> for a decade. I prefer not to be traced when browsing the Internet and I want to be free to switch anytime between the major desktop platforms. I would love to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozFirefoxOS">Firefox OS</xref> once it runs on a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibFairphone">responsible</xref> phone. Sorry, I have not yet contributed to any of these three major products so far. However, I use projects powered by Mozilla technologies or Firefox extensions, and contribute to some: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibPaperMachinesFork">Paper Machines</xref> for visual text analytics in bibliography manager <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibZotero">Zotero</xref>, GUI prototyping tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibPencil">Pencil</xref> for sketching diagrams and ideas. So I have already been attracted to Mozilla first as a <bold>user</bold>. What could be better than being hired to improve one's favorite tools? But wait, there is a catch. As Jennifer Morrow wrote on her last <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibJenniferMorrow">post</xref> before her departure from Mozilla UX: <italic>Scratch-your-own-itch hacker culture assumes the creators of technology are its users, which deemphasizes the need for usability and accessibility.</italic></p>
			</sec>
			<sec id="secWhyMozResearcher" sec-type="secWhyMozResearcher">
				<title>Why Mozilla? A researcher's perspective.</title>
				<p>Beyond being a <bold>user</bold>, the third word in the position title is <bold>researcher</bold>. From my experience in academia I have learned that scientific researchers question issues, try to create or improve solutions to solve these, and document their findings ideally on publications. Speaking of publications, let's assume we want to first trace all scientific publications authored by direct members of Mozilla (including the staff from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozillaScienceLab">Mozilla Science Lab</xref> would make it harder). This cover letter may be more similar to a position paper than to a scientific article, thus a proper systematic literature overview can be considered off-topic. To get an estimate, we can search the ACM Digital Library first for publications whose authors are affiliated to Mozilla. The query can be defined as follows: <italic>persons.authors.affiliation:(+mozilla)</italic>. This leads us to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibACMDLMoz">40 results</xref>.</p>
				<p>Among these results, how many are related to user experience? Instead of enforcing keywords such as <italic>user experience</italic> or <italic>usability</italic> onto the search, I propose to first collect some clues elsewhere. On the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozillaResearch">Mozilla Research blog</xref>, posts can currently belong to the following categories: <italic>Emscripten</italic>, <italic>Events</italic>, <italic>Rust</italic>, <italic>Servo</italic>, <italic>Shumway</italic>, <italic>Uncategorized</italic>. Most of these are web-based multimedia technologies. To narrow down results to publications concerning user experience, I thus propose to filter web technologies and programming languages employed at Mozilla from the title and abstract and <italic>multimedia</italic> from the publication source title. The query can then be refined as follows: <italic>persons.authors.affiliation:(+mozilla) AND recordAbstract:(-javascript -rust -c++ -java -html -http -python -language -Emscripten -Rust -Servo -Shumway) AND acmdlTitle:(-javascript -rust -c++ -java -html -http -python -language -Emscripten -Rust -Servo -Shumway) AND acmdlPublicationTitle:(-*multimedia)</italic>. This leads us to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibACMDLMozUX">8 results</xref>: 2 tutorials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozOpenSym14">OpenSym14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozSIGCSE14">SIGCSE'14</xref>), 2 workshops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozRELENG13">RELENG'13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozRELENG15">RELENG'15</xref>, more related to quality assurance), 1 long paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozCSCW13">CSCW'13</xref>), 1 keynote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozSPLASH13">SPLASH'13</xref>), 1 panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozCHI09">CHI'09</xref>), 1 artistic demo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozSA12">SA'12</xref>).</p>
				<p>One first finding from this literature overview from Mozilla authors related to user experience research is that both the variety of presentation types and the variety of affiliations among co-authors may incline to think that Mozilla researchers are open to discuss their practices and collaborate with academic and industrial partners. As a potential Mozilla UX researcher, I would enjoy collaborating with academic/industrial peers and publishing research results with the UX team.</p>

				<title>Why Mozilla UX? A user researcher passion.</title>
				<p>On a recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozFirefoxUXDesignValues">website</xref>, people from the Firefox UX team outline their design process and values that have been elaborated for years. One quite attractive figure illustrates their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figMozFirefoxUXDesignProcess">Design Process</xref>. There are five phases: 1) Conduct research on human needs and behavior. 2) Create concepts by blending research findings, technological insights and Mozilla mission values. 3) Iterate on design by prototyping, testing and refining. 4) Build and ship. 5) Measure with people. Address issues from the core before prototypes are made. I have been following an iterative process very similar phases for my research on HCI through engineering and usability. I would like to remain actively involved on all these phases, shall I become a member of the Firefox UX team.</p>
				<p>On the same <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozFirefoxUXDesignValues">website</xref>, people from the Firefox UX team also define their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figMozFirefoxUXDesignValues">Design Values</xref>. One key advantage from the chosen visualization as a donut chart is that user experience researchers can use it as a framework to analyze a research process, and display, by sizing the areas of each value accordingly to their completeness, how the process fits the framework. I will continue by explaining how our values can relate.</p>

			<p>My code of conduct and criteria for a good career as user experience researcher can be organized as follows:</p>
			<sec id="sCodePassion" sec-type="codePassion">
				<title>Work driven by passion and emotion</title>
				<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozSA12">Art installation</xref><italic>Weburette</italic> from Akatsuka Daisuke (Mozilla Japan), cited here before, transduces the flow of processes issued when loading a web page into liquids, mapping information (networking, building the DOM, number of links, local storage, visited links, garbage collection) to different fluids. Visuals are available on his collaborator Tomoki Hiramoto's Behance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibTomokiHiramotoWeburette">gallery</xref>. Past the information display, this installation directly fascinates and triggers emotion. It makes me recall amused reactions of people discovering <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figLavaAMP">LavaAMP</xref>, an <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibLavaAMP">installation</xref> that Eric Schayes and I created  that is quite similar since it browses music through liquids, it surrounds the beats in music tracks by streaming colorful blobs. This was one of my best experience of designing a system: the chills for creating it, and the satisfaction seen on people discovering it. But wait, were people really satisfied? This would require proper evaluation methods.</p>

				<title>Evaluate ideas and prototypes with people</title>
				<p>My Myers-Briggs Type of personality Indicator (MBTI) is Introvert iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving (INFP), which confirms that I can be very empathetic to people and a good listener. This trait of personality helped me run contextual inquiries, particularly as 1:1 interviews. Trained in an engineering environment, I am also accustomed to making surveys, mostly for feedback after user testing and evaluation, from my <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figPhDThumbs">PhD</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibChristianFrissonPhD">thesis</xref>. I always make sure to formulate questions in surveys so that answers can be analyzed quantitatively. Throughout the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibAuracle">Auracle</xref> project I have also learned how to measure where and how people look with eye tracking. I find that Alex Wright's rendering of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figAlexWrightUXMethodsSpace">space for UX methods</xref> shown during his workshop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibAlexWrightHumanizingData"><italic>Humanizing data</italic></xref> outlines well usability methods by positioning these on two axes: attitudinal-behavioral and qualitative-quantitative. During Alex Wright's workshop, I have also learned Kawakita Jiro analysis, a technique for groups with which people first silently jot down their ideas and observations to post-its and then these can be clustered and categorized to structure the analysis and make results emerge. What to do with the results next?</p>

				<title>Open research results (documentation, datasets and code)</title>
				<p>Reading Bruce Sterling's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibBruceSterlingShapingThings">book</xref> <italic>Shaping Things</italic> felt really inspiring. Particularly how he illustrates his vision with his passionate story around a bottle of wine, <italic>gizmo</italic> wine. By the way, have you spotted the glass in the Mozilla UX <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figMozFirefoxUXDesignProcess">Design Process</xref>? Published in 2005, a decade ago, some ideas feel not so futuristic anymore: the <italic>spime</italic> and the <italic>Internet of Things</italic>. He <italic>entroduces</italic> his book by calling for makers and designers of <italic>decent</italic> technologies, that are <italic>fully documented, trackable, searchable</italic>.</p>
				<p>I strongly believe that publishing research results is a requirement for ensuring that ideas get traced, understood, iterated. I try to publish most source code related to my research results as much as I'm allowed to, and mostly on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibChristianFrissonGithub">github</xref>. Doug Cook's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibDougCookViz">project</xref> for a course in visualization at Berkeley from Fall 2014 shows in one <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figDougCookGithubPrVsOrg">visualization</xref> that Mozilla has been the organization owning the greatest amount of projects on github from May to September 2013. Mozilla UX team members publish their findings on their <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozUX">blog</xref> and in publications as overviewed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozCHI09">CHI'09</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozCSCW13">CSCW'13</xref>).</p>

				<p>Creativity and flow require <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibBrainPickingsSolitude">solitude</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibBrainPickingsAlone">aloneness</xref>. I believe that offices are really necessary for organizations producing technologies when teams develop or use specific hardware, or need to collaborate together. Great, Mozilla teams seem to mostly work on software and use off-the-shelf hardware (let alone the recent work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozFactory">Mozilla Factory</xref>). I also like that most positions can be acted remotely at Mozilla and that Mozilla offers a travel and conference budget including for meeting people for usability evaluations.</p>
				<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibBretVictorClimateChange">Bret Victor</xref>, technologists should invest their time and skills in addressing the issue of climate change. One partial solution seems to be reducing petroleum waste from transportation. The most polluting mode of transportation ranked in his article is personal passenger vehicles, way above flights. When the schedule calls for personal work, I find it better to fuel creativity by remote working alone than spoiling commuting time and energy. But real, physical, tangible human contact is necessary for collaborations, for better understanding people, and for evaluations with users.</p>

				<title>Firefox workflow analysis</title>
				<p>I talked earlier about <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibAlexWrightHumanizingData"><italic>Alex Wright</italic></xref>'s two-dimensional rendering of a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figAlexWrightUXMethodsSpace">definition space for UX methods</xref>. Christian Rohrer from the Nielsen/Norman Group proposes a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibChristianRohrerUXMethods">variant</xref> by adding a third dimension: the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figChristianRohrerUXMethodsSpace">context of product use</xref>. This underlines one significant issue: into what extent do people that test products iterations actually use these products? How can we analyze the workflow of people beyond one product that we want to test?</p>
				<p>Are there Mozilla UX projects addressing this issue? I could stumble upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozTestPilot">Test Pilot</xref> which was an extension for Firefox allowing people to take part in studies and submit their data. Lots of test cases and findings were released until 2013 and 2014. The departure of its main developer seems to have stalled the project. Digging deeper brings us to the upcoming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozWikiIdeaTown">Idea Town</xref>, with a mockup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozIdeaTownSplash">splash</xref> nicely designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibJohnGruenGithub">John Gruen</xref> from Mozilla UX. I am eager to get to know more!</p>
				<p>During the past semester I have been developing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figInspectorWidgetWorkflow">InspectorWidget</xref>, an opensource system to analyze users behaviors in their applications. InspectorWidget works on closed applications that do not provide source code nor scripting capabilities, but as well on opensource applications such as tools made by Mozilla. InspectorWidget covers the whole pipeline of software analysis from logging input events to visual statistics through browsing and programmable annotation. InspectorWidget allows post-recording logging, that is defining metrics of observation after recording and logging. InspectorWidget does not require programming skills. To achieve this, InspectorWidget combines low-level event logging (e.g. mouse and keyboard events) and high-level screen features (e.g. interface widgets) captured though computer vision techniques. I have started collaborations on it with researchers interested in how people deal with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibGillesBailly">menus</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibSylvainMalacria">shortcuts</xref>, among other GUI widgets and interaction techniques. We believe that InspectorWidget can benefit end users, usability experts and HCI researchers. The current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figInspectorWidgetPrototype">prototype</xref> is almost on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibInspectorWidgetGithub">github</xref>.</p>

				<title>Browsing bookmarks and histories</title>
				<p>Last year I stumbled by chance upon the Mozilla Chronicle project. When I saw the figures on its <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozChronicleTumblr">tumblr</xref>, I was immediately attracted by the second <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figMozChronicleModel"><italic>Context and View Frequency of History Items</italic></xref>. How many times have I lost track of bookmarks even if I kept a folder system with careful choices on breadth and depth! This left me wondering whether Chronicle would be a project centered on information visualization of browsing histories. During my <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figPhDThumbs">PhD</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibChristianFrissonPhD">thesis</xref> I have produced a thorough state-of-the-art on the design space of media/file browsers illustrated with numerous examples.

This use case sounds very similar to browsing a collection of bookmarks with thumbnails.

				<p>The current research tracks of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibMozVR">MozVR</xref> team focus on the browsing experience using off-the-shelf virtual reality devices, currently the Oculus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibOculusRift">Rift</xref> for display. How can people interact in virtual reality? A companion off-the-shelf device, the Oculus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibOculusTouch">Touch</xref>, is a split gamepad that two-handed users hold with their hands, one pad in each. While its description states that user movement sensing is precise, how do users receive feedback from their actions and behavior?

				<p>InspectorWidget is an opensource system to analyze users behaviors in their applications. Its workflow: the experimenter records users' activity, then browses the recordings and programs annotations. InspectorWidget then automates annotations that the experimenter can analyze using the provided visualization tool, Data can be exported for processing in a different statistical analysis tool.

				<title>AudioMetro: evaluation content presentation layouts</title>
				<p>AudioMetro is an interactive visualization of sound collections. Sounds are represented by content-based glyphs, mapping perceptual sharpness (audio) to brightness and contour (visual). These glyphs are positioned in a starfield display using Student t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) for dimension reduction, then a proximity grid optimized for preserving direct neighbors. Known-item search evaluation shows that our technique significantly outperforms a grid of sounds represented by dots and ordered by filename. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibAudioMetro">Findings</xref> published.</p>

				<title/>
				<p>Information visualization is the transformation of abstract data into visual, interactive representations. InfoPhys is a device that enables the direct, tangible manipulation of visualizations. InfoPhys makes use of a force-feedback pointing device to simulate haptic feedback while the user explores visualizations projected on top of the device. We present a use case illustrating the trends in ten years of TEI proceedings and how InfoPhys allows users to feel and manipulate these trends.

				<p>The Web Audio Haptics WAC Tutorial 2016 will explore how to create meaningful haptic content that engages different areas of the body using off-the-shelf hardware and open source software running on a web browser using Web Audio technologies. The tutorial aims to teach participant an easy-to-use method to create dynamic haptic content as well as to give participants an understanding of apparent tactile illusions, a perception of illusory motion between two areas on the body, and apply this knowledge towards generating personalized haptic experiences.
